Activity 3: Manage Receptionist Onboarding and Records
================================================================================

User Action 1: Display Add Receptionist Form
Description:
As an Admin, I want to view a web form for entering new receptionist details so that I can onboard new receptionists efficiently and ensure all required information is collected.
* The Add Receptionist form is displayed to the Admin user and includes fields for first name, last name, and phone number.
* All required fields in the Add Receptionist form must be filled before the form can be submitted.
* Submitting the form sends the receptionist details to the backend via HTTP POST for processing.
* If the receptionist record is inserted successfully, the Admin is notified with a success message and redirected to the admin home page.
* If the receptionist record insertion fails due to incorrect data, the Admin is alerted and redirected back to the Add Receptionist form for correction.

User Action 2: Submit Receptionist Registration
Description:
As an Admin, I want to submit the receptionist registration form so that the new receptionist's details are sent to the backend for processing and storage.
* The receptionist registration form must display all required fields for first name, last name, and phone number before submission.
* Submitting the registration form sends receptionist details to the backend via HTTP POST for processing.
* The backend must validate the submitted receptionist details and record the current date and time of registration.
* If the receptionist record is inserted successfully into the database, the user is notified of success and redirected to the admin home page.
* If the receptionist record insertion fails due to incorrect data, the user is alerted and redirected back to the registration form for correction.

User Action 3: Process Receptionist Submission
Description:
As an Admin, I want the backend to validate and process receptionist registration submissions so that only valid data is inserted into the system and errors are handled appropriately.
* The backend must receive receptionist registration submissions via HTTP POST and extract all required fields (first name, last name, phone).
* The backend must validate that all required receptionist fields are present and not empty before attempting to insert into the database.
* The backend must record the current date and time for each receptionist registration and include it in the database record.
* If the receptionist record is inserted successfully, the system must notify the user of success and redirect to the admin home page.
* If the receptionist record insertion fails due to incorrect or missing data, the system must alert the user and redirect back to the add receptionist form for correction.
* No receptionist record should be inserted into the database if required fields are missing or invalid.

User Action 4: Handle Successful Receptionist Registration
Description:
As an Admin, I want to be notified when a receptionist is registered successfully so that I know the onboarding process is complete and can proceed with other tasks.
* When a receptionist registration is successful, the admin receives a notification indicating the success of the operation.
* After successful registration, the system redirects the admin to the admin home page.
* The notification of successful registration is displayed immediately after the receptionist record is inserted into the database.
* No notification of success is shown if the receptionist registration fails.

User Action 5: Handle Failed Receptionist Registration
Description:
As an Admin, I want to be alerted if receptionist registration fails due to incorrect data so that I can correct the information and resubmit the form.
* When receptionist registration fails due to incorrect data, the system displays an alert message to the admin indicating the failure.
* After a failed registration attempt, the admin is redirected back to the add receptionist form to correct and resubmit the information.
* The system does not insert any receptionist record into the database if the submitted data is incorrect or incomplete.
* The admin can immediately attempt to correct the data and resubmit the form after being notified of the failure.

User Action 6: View and Manage Receptionist List
Description:
As an Admin, I want to view, search, edit, and delete receptionist records in a dynamic table so that I can efficiently manage receptionist information and keep records up to date.
* The receptionist list displays all registered receptionists in a dynamic table format.
* The receptionist list can be filtered by first name or last name using a search input.
* Each receptionist record in the table includes options to edit or delete the record.
* Editing a receptionist record allows the admin to update the receptionist's details and save changes.
* Deleting a receptionist record removes the receptionist from the list and the database.
* The table updates in real time to reflect any changes made by editing or deleting records.
* If no receptionist matches the search query, the table displays an empty result or appropriate message.
