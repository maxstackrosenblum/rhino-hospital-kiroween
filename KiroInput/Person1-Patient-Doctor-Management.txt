Activity 1: Manage Patient Records
================================================================================

User Action 1: Initiate Patient Management Action

* When the user chooses to add a new patient, the system displays a patient registration form with required fields and validates the input before submission.
* When the user chooses to search for or list patients, the system displays a paginated table of patient records with options to edit or delete each record.
* When the user chooses to update an existing patient, the system allows selection of a patient and displays a pre-filled update form for editing patient details.
* When the user chooses to delete a patient, the system allows selection of a patient and confirms the deletion action before removing the record from the system.
* The system provides feedback to the user after each action (add, update, delete) indicating success or failure.
